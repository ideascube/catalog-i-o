## Catalogs

Catalogs are YAML files describing the packages that can be installed using
ideascube. Each package has a set of metadata, which set depends on the type of
media.


## Available catalogs

... At least, available here. Some other may exists elsewhere.


## kiwix.yml

The ZIMs we needed from Kiwix.org.

See [kiwix](kiwix.md) for details.


## static-sites.yml

Websites dumps.

Use `httrack(1)` or whatever fits your needs.


## Other catalogs

For now, each catalogs embbeds a different type of medias.

Nothing is fixed and you may find useful to have some catalogs by theme,
language, recipient, whatever.

* [Yohan has a catalog](http://catalog.yohanboniface.me/catalog.yml), too. Full of OSM maps.
* [bibliotecamovil.yml](../bibliotecamovil.yml) is a packages collection for
some project in Colombia.
* [kb-demo-usa.yml](../kb-demo-usa.yml) as the name says, is a specific demo set of packages.
